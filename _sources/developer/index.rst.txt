Developer Guide
===============
This guide is intended for developers to help them understand the structure of Readvice.
All the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt file.
Users can run the following command to install the dependencies:

   .. code-block:: python

         python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Code Structure
--------------

dbinit.py file contains all the necessary information to create the database.
Database is initialized using the following queries:

   .. code-block:: python

      INIT_STATEMENTS = [
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS REVIEW",
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ADMINS",
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BOOKWORM",
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS GENRES",
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BOOK",
         "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS AUTHOR",

         """CREATE TABLE AUTHOR(
            ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(2000),
            PHOTO VARCHAR(200)
         )""",

         """CREATE TABLE BOOK(
            ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            TITLE VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
            YR INTEGER CHECK(YR>=0 AND YR<=2019),
            AUTHORID INTEGER REFERENCES AUTHOR ON DELETE SET NULL,
            PGNUM INTEGER CHECK(PGNUM>=0),
            COVER VARCHAR(200),
            DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(2000)
         )""",

         """CREATE TABLE BOOKWORM(
            ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            USERNAME VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            PASSWORD VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            EMAIL VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            PROFILEPICTURE VARCHAR(30),
            GENDER VARCHAR(10)
         )""",

         """CREATE TABLE REVIEW(
            ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            SCORE INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(SCORE>=1 AND SCORE<=10),
            COMMENT VARCHAR(2000),
            DATEWRITTEN TIMESTAMP,
            BOOKID INTEGER REFERENCES BOOK ON DELETE CASCADE,
            USERID INTEGER REFERENCES BOOKWORM ON DELETE CASCADE
         )""",

         """CREATE TABLE ADMINS(
            ADMINID INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES BOOKWORM ON DELETE CASCADE
         )""",

         """CREATE TABLE GENRES(
            BOOKID INTEGER REFERENCES BOOK ON DELETE CASCADE,
            GENRE VARCHAR(20)
         )"""
      ]

Initialization functions:

   .. code-block:: python

      def initialize(url):
         with dbapi2.connect(url) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            for statement in INIT_STATEMENTS:
                  cursor.execute(statement)
            cursor.close()

      if __name__ == "__main__":
         url = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
         if url is None:
            print("Usage: DATABASE_URL=url python dbinit.py", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)
         initialize(url)

Database is initialized using "DATABASE_URL=url python dbinit.py" command.
It requires a valid database url to be entered.

Explanation and an example of what each file does is given below:

All the routes are created and the application is initialized in server.py file.
An example of adding routes to the application is given below:

   .. code-block:: python

      app.add_url_rule("/", view_func=views.home_page)

View functions for routes are stored in views.py file.
View function of home page is given below:

   .. code-block:: python

      def home_page():
         searchform=SearchForm()
         db = current_app.config["db"]
         books = db.get_top_books()
         return render_template("home.html", books=books, searchform=searchform)

database.py file contains the functions to interact with the database.
The function that returns the Top 10 books in the database is given below:

   .. code-block:: python

      def get_top_books(self):
         books = []
         with dbapi2.connect(self.db_url) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            query = """SELECT BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE, BOOK.YR, BOOK.COVER, AVG(REVIEW.SCORE)
            FROM BOOK INNER JOIN REVIEW ON BOOK.ID = REVIEW.BOOKID
            GROUP BY BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE, BOOK.YR, BOOK.COVER
            ORDER BY AVG(REVIEW.SCORE) DESC
            LIMIT 10"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            for book_id, title, year, cover, avgscore in cursor:
                books.append(Book(id=book_id, title=title, year=year, cover=cover, avgscore=avgscore))
        return books

forms.py file contains forms created with WTForms package.

   .. code-block:: python

      class SearchForm(FlaskForm):
         query = StringField("Search...", validators=[DataRequired()])

author.py, book.py, review.py and user.py files contain
classes for author, book, review and bookworm entities.

   .. code-block:: python

      class Review:
         def __init__(self, author, book, score=None,
         comment=None, id=None, datewritten=None):
            self.author = author
            self.book = book
            self.score = score
            self.comment = comment
            self.id = id
            self.datewritten = datewritten

settings.py file contains basic configuration for the applicataion.
